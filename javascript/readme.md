##Running Locally

Clone or download the repository, and navigate your terminal to the root directory of the demo. This should be where `index.html` is sitting.

Run your package manager of choice, be it ethier `yarn` or `npm` like so,

```
npm install
```

```
yarn install
```

These should create some new files and directories.

Now run the command
`parcel index.html`

This should create a local server running the Charts demo. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234` in the url bar. If all has gone well, you will have some data to play with!

Happy Charting! ðŸš€ðŸ“ˆ
